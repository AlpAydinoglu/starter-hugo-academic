I am a doctoral candidate in the ESE department and the GRASP Lab at Penn. I work in the DAIR Laboratory where I am advised by Michael Posa. Previously, I was an undergraduate at Istanbul Technical University where I did two different thesis projects advised by M. Turan Söylemez and Neslihan Serap Şengör.

I am interested in intersection of robotics, control theory, mechanics (particularly non-smooth mechanics) and optimization. Currently, I am working on real-time multi-contact optimal control. One of my more recent interests is estimator design for hybrid, particularly multi-contact systems and I am also exploring reinforcement learning for the same class of systems.
