I am a doctoral candidate in the ESE department and the GRASP Lab at Penn where I am advised by Michael Posa. Previously, I was an undergraduate at Istanbul Technical University where I worked with İbrahim Eksin, Turan Söylemez and Neslihan Şengör.

I am interested in robots that make and break contact with their environment. I work in the intersection of robotics, optimization, control theory, learning and non-smooth mechanics. Currently, I am developing a real-time multi-contact model predictive control algorithm with a focus on dynamic manipulation tasks.
